# Car-Prices-data-Canada-Market-

In this project, I employed a Simple Linear Regression model to predict car prices in the Canadian car market annually. The goal was to provide a straightforward tool for estimating future car prices. By running the provided code, users can easily predict car prices for any year (Say, for the year 2060). This initiative aimed to offer a user-friendly solution for forecasting car prices in the future.
